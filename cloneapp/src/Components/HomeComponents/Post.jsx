        ðŸš¨ The Harsh Reality of the Graphic Design Industry! I recently came
        across a job posting for a Graphic Designerâ€”but what I saw in the
        requirements section completely shocked me! Apparently, to be a graphic
        designer today, you also need to be a: âœ… Video Editor âœ… Motion
        Graphics Artist âœ… UI/UX Designer âœ… 3D Modeler âœ… Print & Packaging
        Designer âœ… Illustrator âœ… Branding Expert âœ… Social Media Strategist âœ…
        AR/VR Designer âœ… AI Art Generator Expert Oh, and letâ€™s not
        forgetâ€”proficient in all Adobe software, Figma, Blender, After Effects,
        and even coding in HTML & CSS! And whatâ€™s the reward for being this
        Superhuman Designer? A salary so low that even freelancers with basic
        skills earn more. The worst part? These job listings stay open for
        months because no one is crazy enough to be a master of everything while
        working endless hours for peanuts. It's frustrating to see companies
        undervalue specialized skills like this. Graphic Design isn't a
        one-size-fits-all jobâ€”itâ€™s an art that takes years to master! Companies
        need to understand that: ðŸš« A motion designer isnâ€™t a UI/UX expert ðŸš« A
        print designer isnâ€™t a 3D modeler ðŸš« A graphic designer isnâ€™t a
        full-stack developer Hiring one person for ten jobs and paying them less
        than one is NOT the way forward! Fellow designers, have you come across
        such unrealistic job postings? How do you deal with this madness?
